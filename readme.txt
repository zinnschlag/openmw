BUILD FROM SOURCE

TODO add description here


THE DATA PATH

The data path tells OpenMW where to find your Morrowind files. From 0.12.0 on OpenMW should be able to
pick up the location of these files on its own, if both Morrowind and OpenMW are installed properly
(installing Morrowind under WINE is considered a proper install).

If that does not work for you, please check if you have any leftover openmw.cfg files from versions earlier than 0.12.0. These can interfere with the configuration process, so try to remove then.

If you are running OpenMW without installing it, you still need to manually adjust the data path. Create a text file named openmw.cfg in the location of the binary and enter the following line:

data=path to your data directory

(where you replace "path to your data directory" with the actual location of your data directory)
