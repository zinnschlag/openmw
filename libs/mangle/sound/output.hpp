/// Abstract interface for a single playable sound
/** This class represents one sound outlet, which may be played,
    stopped, paused and so on.

    Sound instances are created from the SoundFactory class. Sounds
    may be connected to a SampleSource or read directly from a file,
    and they may support 3d sounds, looping and other features
    depending on the capabilities of the backend system.

    To create multiple instances of one sound, it is recommended to
    'clone' an existing instance instead of reloading it from
    file. Cloned sounds will often (depending on the back-end) use
    less memory due to shared buffers.
